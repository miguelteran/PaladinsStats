Events in the Realm have upset the balance, leading to the Abyss’ influence creeping ever closer, and so the Eternal descends from on high to deliver a final warning to the Realm: deal with the Abyss, or have it be dealt with, by any means deemed necessary -- even if that means others may suffer.",

He is Corvus, The Magistrate’s Blade. He is the son of Karne, the powerful leader of the Magistrate, but it is by his own merit that he has earned the absolute loyalty of his men and instilled fear in his enemies.\n\nA charismatic leader and brilliant tactician, Corvus stopped at nothing to see his goals realized: a peace to surpass that of the Golden Age, under the Magistrate’s rule. With the near-limitless energy of the Abyss, bent to his iron will, and those soldiers still loyal to his vision of peace, he did what no other was capable of.\n\nThrough his actions, Corvus summoned chaos, and slowly lost all he had earned, even to the grave.

Her sincere dedication to her family's legacy may have earned her the title of Scion, but her skill with the rifle is what won her the respect of her family's Royal Guard.\n\nWhen the Magistrate called on all loyal houses to unite against the Resistance, she was honor-bound to accept, arriving from her far-off homeland to represent House Aico along with her faithful bodyguard and general, Khan, and her closest advisor, Rei. Her politics were only further rewarded when Karne stepped down, abdicating the Magistrate and the title Grand Magister, to her and House Aico.",

Yet, this proud life would not last forever. Gravely wounded in a border incursion by Resistance fighters, Lillith painstakingly crawled away from the battlefield, cursing those who brought her to death’s door. What Lillith didn’t know – what she couldn’t have imagined, was that the Abyss would reach out to her and offer her a gift…an offer that was too powerful to refuse.\n\nNow, Lilith reigns from her dark corners of the Realm. Aided by her unnaturally long life and keen mind, Lillith dashes from shadow to shadow with her deadly Heart of Crimson: a sinister weapon that swells with unnatural power whenever it tastes the blood of her enemies.

She would show the Pyre the power of freedom, true freedom. Approaching the one who would eventually be know as Seris, they devised a plan for Nyx to begin her great betrayal. Nyx left the Pyre behind and traveled through one of Seris' portals into a Lord's fortress. Once there Nyx slew and subdued all who stood in her way in a violent bloodbath. Even the residing Lord was no match for her fury, their name lost to time - cementing herself as an Abyssal Lord. Her time in the Abyss has changed her physically, but she remains determined to bring a new age of chaos and freedom to the Realm. With her growing army behind her, she offers power to those who will accept it: a united front through strength and the chaos of free will - a force strong enough to overwhelm the Pyre wholly.",

But for true justice to prevail, the order would need more than pious Judges. They'd need an Executioner. Someone unburdened by the trappings of mercy who would ensure that judgements cast were judgements kept.\n\nVII is one whose past is chronicled upon the gravestones of the wicked. He is the grim reaper; a collector of tithes made in guilty blood. Like a phantom, he undertakes missions that would break most, employing ruthless force and deadly precision.

By the time he was a man, he'd won the loyalty of enough thieves, assassins, and corrupt bureaucrats to build his own shadowy empire: the Thousand Hands Guild.\n\nAnyone scheming against him has a tendency to vanish in the middle of the night, while those who confront him directly meet their doom at the end of his wicked flaming sword. He once refused to pick a side, as it was easier to make a profit from the conflict. \n\nBut with the Resistance gone, and the Guild stronger than ever, he can meet the Magistrate head-on and exact revenge against House Aico & the Grand Magister who took it all from him.",
